When you see the list of shoe results, select any pair to see a detailed rundown of the shoe and its resell prices.

================

While in the detailed shoe screen after selecting a shoe:

The table view displays the current resale values for the shoe on the 4 major reselling platforms (Goat.com, StockX.com, Flightclub.com, and StadiumGoods.com)

It provides the resale value based on the size of the shoe. If the price is $0.0, that is indicative that the site does not have that size for sale.

The switch on the bottom left of the view allows you to see the value of the shoes after fees and shipping are taken out from the resale prices. This by default is turned off.
This will be your net income from selling on that platform

Fees and shipping vary from site to site.

Above the table of prices, will be several stats about the shoe, such as the style code, color way, retail price, and release date.

TO ADD A SHOE TO YOUR PORTFOLIO:

1. Select a row in the resale table (ie. the size you want to add)
2. Tap “Add to Portfolio” in the bottom right.
3. The shoe is now added to Core Data, and your personal portfolio.

================

After selecting “View Portfolio” from the main screen:

You will see a table of shoes you have added to your portfolio/collection via the search function (previously described)

If you have not added any shoes to your portfolio, see: “TO ADD A SHOE TO YOUR PORTFOLIO” in the previous section, as your portfolio is initially empty

Each shoe that you have added to your portfolio will be listed in the table, along with its average resell price (from the 4 platforms) according to the size you added

Above the table of shoes in your portfolio will be stats regarding your portfolio. These stats will be the total value of your portfolio, average price per pair in your portfolio, and total number of shoes in your portfolio.

To delete a shoe from your portfolio, swipe left on the shoe in the table, and press the red delete button. This will delete it from core data.

SHOES IN PORTFOLIO ARE PERSISTENT (ie. stored in core data)
